It is consistent with the \nobjectives of this Regulation that these minimum energy performance requirements \nmay in certain circumstances limit the installation of energy-related products which \ncomply with this Regulation and its delegated acts, provided that such requirements do \nnot constitute an unjustifiable market barrier. \n(13) \nIn order to improve the environmental sustainability of products and to ensure the free \nmovement of products in the internal market, the power to adopt acts in accordance \nwith Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to supplement this \nRegulation by setting out ecodesign requirements.

In cases \nwhere relevant information on a product’s performance in relation to a product \nparameter cannot be included as supplementary information in the energy label \nestablished for the energy-related product pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1369, the \nCommission should assess whether a label in accordance with this Regulation is to be \nestablished, taking into account the need for consumers to be informed on the most \nrelevant parameters for the product and the disadvantages in terms of risks of \nconfusion for the public and of excessive administrative burden for e\n\n[Page 102]: et \nprovides a critical mass enabling the EU to promote product sustainability and to \ninfluence product design and value chain management worldwide.  \n1.5.3. \nLessons learned from similar experiences in the past \nThere is a long experience of regulating first energy-using and then energy related \nproducts at EU level. The current Directive 2009/125, the Ecodesign Directive \nprovides the basis for product specific measures that have been adopted. The benefits \nhave been documented in annual Ecodesign impact accounting reports showing the \nmainly energy benefits accompanied by other emission and resource benefits.  \nWhile a number of evaluations  of the Ecodesign Directive have confirmed its clear \nrelevance and effectiveness as a regulatory tool, they point to potential to improve its \nimplementation and enforcement. A 2012 evaluation, for example, noted that “while \nit is broadly recognised that the energy efficiency aspects of the SCP/SIP Action Plan  \nand of EU resource efficiency p\n\n[Page 60]:  better \nperforming products.  \n3. \nFor energy-related products, where information on a relevant product parameter, \nincluding on classes of performance referred to in Article 7(4), cannot be \nincorporated in the energy label established pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2017/1369, \nthe Commission, after assessing the best way to communicate about this particular \ninformation, may, if appropriate, require the establishment of a label in accordance \nwith this Regulation. \n4. \nWhen establishing the information requirements referred to in paragraph 1, the \nCommission shall, where appropriate, require the label to include data carriers or \nother means to allow customers to access additional information on the product, \nincluding means allowing access to the product passport referred to in Article 8.  \n5. \nThe Commission may adopt implementing acts establishing common requirements \nfor the layout of the labels required pursuant to Article 7(6), point (d). \nThose implementing acts shall be adopted\n\n[Page 23]: rocurement criteria and for bans on the destruction \nof unsold consumer products. \n(20) \nPerformance requirements should relate to a selected product parameter relevant to the \ntargeted product aspect for which potential for improving environmental sustainability \nhas been identified. Such requirements may include minimum or maximum levels of \nperformance in relation to the product parameter, non-quantitative requirements that \naim to improve performance in relation to the product parameter, or requirements \nrelated to a product’s functional performance to ensure that the selected performance \nrequirements do not negatively impact the ability of the product to perform the \nfunction for which it was designed and marketed. Regarding minimum or maximum \nlevels, they may for example take the form of a limit on energy consumption in the use \nphase or on the quantities of a given material incorporated in the product, a \nrequirement for minimum quantities of recycled content, or a limit on a \n\n[Page 29]: conomic \noperators. \n(41) \nConsumers should be protected from misleading information that could hamper their \nchoices for more sustainable products. For this reasons it should be prohibited to place \non the market products bearing a label mimicking the labels provided for in this \nRegulation.  \n(42) \nTo deliver in the most efficient way on the European Green Deal’s objectives and to \naddress the most impactful products first, the Commission should carry out a \nprioritisation of products to be regulated under this Regulation and requirements that \nwill apply to them. Based on the process followed for prioritisation under Directive \n2009/125/EC, the Commission should adopt a working plan, covering at least 3 years, \nlaying down a list of product groups for which it plans to adopt delegated acts as well \nas the product aspects for which it intends to adopt delegated acts of horizontal \napplication. The Commission should base its prioritisation on a set of criteria \npertaining in particular to the delegated acts’ potential contribution to the Union \nclimate, environmental and energy objectives and their potential for improving the \nproduct aspects selected without disproportionate costs to the public and economic \noperators. Considering their importance for meeting the Union’s energy objectives, the \nworking plans should include an adequate share of actions related to energy-related \nproducts. Member States and stakeholders should also be consulted through the \nEcodesign Forum. Due to the complementarities between this Regulation and \nRegulation (EU) 2017/1369 for energy-related products, the timelines for the working \nplan under this Regulation and the one provided for under Article 15 of Regulation \n(EU) 2017/1369 should be aligned.  \n(43) \nIn addressing construction products, this Regulation should set requirements on final \nproducts only when the obligations created by [the revised Construction Products \n\n\n[Page 7]: a \nstronger contribution.

These evaluations, for example, noted that ‘while it is broadly recognised \nthat the energy efficiency aspects of the SCP/SIP action plan16 and of EU resource efficiency \npolicy can be served by the Ecodesign Directive and the implementing measures, is also \nsuggested by some Member State representatives and by environmental NGOs that there have \nbeen missed opportunities as a result of the limited coverage in implementing measures of \nother environmental aspects’17. The evaluation also highlighted the untapped potential of the \nDirective to address aspects beyond energy efficiency, concluding that ‘there may have been \n                                                 \n14 \nSWD(2019) 92 final. \n15 \nEvaluation of the Ecodesign Directive (2009/125/EC), Centre for Strategy and Evaluation Services \n(CSES), 2012; Evaluation of the Energy Labelling Directive and specific aspects of the Ecodesign \nDirective, Ecofys, June 2014; EU action on Ecodesign and Energy Labelling: important contribution to \ngreater energy efficiency reduced by significant delays and non-compliance, European Court of \nAuditors, Special Report 01/2020. \n16 \nCommunication on the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy \nAction Plan \n17 \nEvaluation of the Ecodesign Directive p.19. \n\n\n[Page 35]: EN \n34 \n EN \nparameters when measured under test conditions and actual functioning, the \nCommission should have access to products’ actual energy consumption while in use \nand where relevant to other performance parameters. To that end, the power to adopt \nacts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the Commission to \nsupplement this Regulation by requiring individual products, similarly to road \nvehicles, to determine their in-use energy consumption and other relevant performance \nparameters and display it to the end-user. For products connected to the internet,  the \npower to adopt acts in accordance with Article 290 TFEU should be delegated to the \nCommission to supplement this Regulation by requiring economic operators to \nremotely collect such in-use data and report it to the Commission, as it is essential to \nidentify how the products perform and to inform the public.

In 2021 the \nCommission adopted the Fit for 55 Package35 to make the Union’s climate and \nenergy policies fit for achieving these objectives.  To do so, in line with the energy \nefficiency first principle enshrined in Directive (EU) 2018/2002 of the European \nParliament and of the Council36, energy efficiency improvements need to be \nsignificantly stepped up, to around 36% in terms of final energy consumption by \n203037.
